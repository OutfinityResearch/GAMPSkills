# Technical Documentation Guidelines

Use this reference when writing or revising the HTML documentation pages under `docs/*.html`.

## Purpose

Write for human readers. Explain what exists, why it exists, and how it behaves in practice. Keep the prose technical, specific, and operational.

## Technical Fidelity

- Check every substantive claim against the codebase before documenting it.
- Do not describe behaviors, automation steps, runtime flows, generated files, APIs, validation guarantees, or architectural layers unless they are confirmed in the implementation.
- Do not invent lifecycle stages, system boundaries, or guarantees because they sound plausible.
- If a statement cannot be confirmed from code, remove it or narrow it until it becomes defensible.
- Keep interpretations modest and close to the implementation.
- Reuse the project's stable vocabulary when canonical architecture texts or reports already define the topic.
- Keep code identifiers, filenames, module names, and exact technical terms unchanged.
- Do not present machine-specific absolute filesystem paths, usernames, home directories, or workstation-local folder layouts as if they were part of the project. Refer to repository-relative paths or project concepts unless an absolute path is itself a real, documented interface requirement.

## Editorial Standard

- Avoid prose that reads like prompt scaffolding, product marketing, or generated filler.
- Avoid meta text about how to read the page.
- Avoid slogan-like headings or generic heading formulas repeated across pages.
- Do not add sections, labels, navigation elements, or other content only to preserve a preferred visual style when the implementation does not need them.
- Adapt chapter titles to the subject of the page while preserving a logical order of ideas.
- Prefer a small number of substantial chapters over many short fragments.
- Keep explanatory text in prose with complete sentences and clear argumentative flow.
- Use lists only when the content is genuinely list-shaped.
- Avoid unexplained abbreviations in general explanatory prose.

## Examples And Callouts

- Use examples when abstract explanation is insufficient.
- Keep examples minimal for starting templates or baseline usage.
- Use extended examples only when optional behavior needs to be shown in context.
- Reserve callout boxes for operationally important information.
- Do not use callouts for decorative emphasis.

## Visual And Responsive Rules

- Keep the reading column comfortable on desktop.
- Set the HTML page title and the visible site/page title to `[project name] Documentation`.
- Prefer a consistent documentation shell with a sidebar or a header-based navigation system.
- Use one primary navigation system per documentation set. Choose either a sidebar or a header-based navigation system based on the project's needs, but do not present both as parallel primary navigation.
- Keep navigation uniform across the HTML pages so moving between files does not change the navigation model unexpectedly.
- Do not repeat navigation links redundantly inside the page body or page header when the same destination is already clearly available in the sidebar or primary navigation shell.
- Prefer full-page documents with substantial sections that read like chapters in a book.
- Do not break the documentation into fragmented card grids or small disconnected components when a continuous reading flow is more appropriate.
- Make pages readable as long-form technical documents, with well-defined sections.
- Ensure navigation supports orientation without competing visually with the main text.
- Include breadcrumbs that let the reader return to `index.html`.
- Keep links visibly identifiable in prose without relying on hover state.
- Avoid dashboard-like UI patterns unless they solve a real documentation problem.
- Collapse layouts on tablet and mobile before text becomes cramped.
- Do not surface workstation-local absolute paths in page chrome, footers, breadcrumbs, captions, or explanatory prose.
- Ensure the HTML navigation exposes a stable path to the specs entry point.
- If a page links to the specs area, route that navigation to `matrix.md` through `docs/specsLoader.html?spec=matrix.md` or an equivalent valid specs entry flow.
- Ensure readers can reach each DS file from `matrix.md`.
- When explaining a runtime flow or generation pipeline, prefer a compact visual diagram over an ASCII block in `<pre><code>` when the diagram improves clarity.
- Keep diagrams technically exact, visually restrained, and readable on mobile.
- Store SVG diagrams and any other documentation assets in `docs/assets/` instead of embedding the asset payload directly in HTML files.
- If SVG diagrams are used, shorten, wrap, or fit labels so text stays inside its visual container.
- When showing a representative directory layout, prefer a visual tree component over a raw ASCII directory dump in `<pre><code>` when the tree is easier to scan.
- Preserve the real file and folder names in any directory tree component.

## Default Outcome

The resulting HTML page should help a technical reader understand the real system faster, without decorative prose, speculative claims, or UI patterns that distract from the text.
