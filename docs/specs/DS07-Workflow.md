# DS07 – Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow outlines a recommended end-to-end path for building a project with GAMPSkills inside AchillesCLI. It describes the order of skills to run, how they interact with specifications and documentation, and when the external AchillesCLI dynamic code generation skill is invoked.

## Recommended Flow
Begin with `init-project` to scaffold `./docs`, `./docs/specs`, `./docs/specs/src`, and `./docs/specs/tests`, copy the static (non-LLM) spec-to-HTML converter into `./docs`, create the initial global DS files under `./docs/specs`, and seed `./specs_backlog.md` and `./docs_backlog.md` with initial questions and proposals. Follow with `create-src-specs` to define detailed technical FDS files in `./docs/specs/src` that mirror the intended `./src` implementation, specifying functions, inputs/outputs, dependencies, and links to tests. Add `create-tests-specs` to author FDS test specifications in `./docs/specs/tests`, describing assertions, expected inputs/outputs, and behaviors to verify, all in natural language or diagrams without code.

After drafting, run `quality-expert` and `review-docs` to surface gaps, inconsistencies, or quality problems. When you want to capture spec issues as backlog tasks, run `backlog-specs-review` to record them in `./specs_backlog.md`, including task descriptions, proposed options, and resolutions. The user reviews and approves backlog items (selecting resolutions). Then use `run-specs-tasks` and `fix-docs` to apply the approved changes to specifications or authored HTML and update the backlogs accordingly. When specifications and docs are ready, invoke the external AchillesCLI dynamic code generation skill explicitly to generate or regenerate code and tests from the specification set. Run `run-tests` to execute the test suite and report pass/fail; any failures are fed back through `quality-expert`, `backlog-specs-review`, and `run-specs-tasks`, followed by regeneration and re-run as needed. Iterate to keep specs, docs, and code aligned.

## Guardrails
Specification files are Markdown (`.md`) under `./docs/specs/**`, and backlogs at the project root remain the gate for any changes—agents propose, users approve. Backlog operations run through BacklogManager as the shared gatekeeper for `./specs_backlog.md` and `./docs_backlog.md`. The static converter copied by `init-project` produces spec HTML for viewing, but `review-docs` focuses only on authored HTML, not the generated spec renderings. Code and test generation are performed outside GAMPSkills by the dedicated AchillesCLI dynamic code generation skill invoked by the user, using the specification files as authoritative input. Fix specs first, then regenerate code and tests.
