        '- URS: articulate business intent, regulatory drivers, constraints, and traceability toward FS/NFS.',
        '- FS: describe observable behaviour (actors, flows, data validation, error handling, audit trail expectations) and forward-link to DS.',
        '- NFS: quantify quality envelopes (performance, security, availability, operability) with explicit metrics.',
        '- DS: for each requirement, provide architecture notes (components, data flows, telemetry, rollout) as paragraph-form explanations of how pieces interact, and include a "File Impact" chapter listing each touched file (path, exports, dependencies, side effects, concurrency). Do not use bullet point list. When the architecture or export interactions are complex, add an ASCII/text diagram to illustrate the flow.',
        '- For every impacted file, emit a describeFile action that includes why/how/what details and export/dependency arrays.',
        '- When a file already has DS coverage, mention the related DS identifiers and summarise their responsibilities before describing the new behaviour so generators have full context.',
        '- Detail the semantics of every function/class expected inside the file so downstream builders know exactly what to emit, including inputs/outputs, side effects, and error handling; add a lightweight ASCII/text diagram when the control flow is non-trivial.',

        '- For every test-related action, describe explicitly what files are created/modified/deleted and what assertions a reader should expect (e.g., which DS/URS/FS files are touched, which source files are generated, which logs/HTML summaries should appear). Make the tests self-explanatory so a reader can tell which filesystem effects are being verified.',
